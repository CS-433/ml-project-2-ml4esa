By Elise Wright Knutsen,
In relation with her 3 month internship at ESA ESTEC with Dr. Olivier Witasse on using EDAC housekeeping data to monitor space weather and climate.

The data in this folder has had very little modifications done to it.

The raw EDAC data set was zero-offset corrected, and resampled to contain daily values. Holes in the data was linearly interpolated, except for the larger period where Rosetta was in hibernation.
